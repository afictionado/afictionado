## About The Project üñºÔ∏è

Afictionado _(portmanteau between "fiction" and "aficionado")_ is an archive for fictional content - original works, fanworks (including fanfiction, edits, fanart, etc.) and anything in between!

### Vision üå†

Coming from a time where what we had was [Wattpad](https://www.wattpad.com/), [AO3](https://archiveofourown.com), I wanted to create a **second Archive of Our Own**, but with a more accessible UI and unified API. What was initially a passion project idea, will, I hope, grow much larger into something people wil enjoy using.

_(No knock on AO3 or the other fanfiction platforms, by the way. We all stand on the shoulders of giants, and I'm infinitely grateful for having AO3 and such.)_

This project wouldn't be possible without these technologies, all of which I'm thankful for having the chance to use. You can expect most if not all of these projects to be open-sourced and free for others to use (non-commercially).
